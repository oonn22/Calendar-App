To run our program simply have Calendar.jar and csc207.db in the same folder and run the jar. Our program can also be
run from Main.java by running the main method.

List of features:
-Everything runs in its own GUI, so there is no need to interact with the console or code
-Our calendar can be viewed in different ways (by day, week, month, and hour) by clicking  the button between the
 arrows when viewing a calendar, or by clicking on an individual day in the calendar. The arrows move the calendar
 through time and we have an optional ability to fill a calendar with public holidays for certain years. The default
 calendar is auto filled with these events.
-A feature that is specific to our team is the ability to share calendars between users, through the button in the view
 calendar menu after logging in.
- Series can be created from existing events, or new events with a set frequency
